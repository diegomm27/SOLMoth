# SOLMoth

The evolution of technology has directly affected telecommunications, with the
emergence of the ability to connect multiple everyday devices to the Internet, allowing
their remote control or the sending of data from them; this is what we call the Internet
of Things (IoT).

Likewise, the rapid growth of the global population and industry has led to a
considerable increase in pollution and the temperature of our planet, directly affecting
bird migration and the periodicity with which birds migrate.

The convergence of these phenomena leads us to propose a system that allows us to
monitor birds and other animals in nature, being able to identify the population of these
at each time of the year. Thus, the SOLMoth device, developed in this project, is
responsible for autonomously capturing the various bird sounds in the area where it is
installed for future classification, sending the data wirelessly.

SOLMoth is an open device that offers a great number of possibilities, starting with the
integration of new devices up to the realization of a classification based on Artificial
Intelligences. In this sense and in collaboration with the Fab lab Smart Open Lab, a
community located in the Escuela Politécnica de Cáceres (EPCC), we developed an
initial prototype based on Raspberry Pi Zero W where we execute the aforementioned
functionalities.

The specifications of autonomy, audio sample recording, data processing, data
sending, OS configuration, as well as the integration and configuration of multiple
components in the same environment have been achieved, concluding in a robust
device whose functionality is in accordance with the specifications.
